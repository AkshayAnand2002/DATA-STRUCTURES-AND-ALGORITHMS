TO CHECK IF STACK ELEMENTS ARE PAIRWISE CONSECUTIVE.
The idea is to use another stack. 
Create an auxiliary stack aux.
Transfer contents of given stack to aux.
While traversing fetch top two elements from aux stack , check if they are consecutive or not. After checking put these elements back to original stack.
Continue this process for all aux stack elements till size of aux stack > 1.
Return Result is TRUE OR FALSE.
