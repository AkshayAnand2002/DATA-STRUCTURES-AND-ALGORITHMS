REVERSING THE FIRST K ELEMENTS OF A QUEUE--
The idea is to use an auxiliary stack. 
Create an empty stack.
One by one dequeue first K items from given queue and push the dequeued items to stack.
Enqueue the contents of stack at the back of the queue
Dequeue (size-k) elements from the front and enqueue them one by one to the same queue.
