1. Initialize current as root 
2. Take to variable max and min 
3. While current is not NULL 
If the current does not have left child 
Update variable max and min with current’s data if required
Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
Else 
Make current as the right child of the rightmost 
node in current’s left subtree
Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left.
So using max and min we traverse the tree to update values of max and min.
