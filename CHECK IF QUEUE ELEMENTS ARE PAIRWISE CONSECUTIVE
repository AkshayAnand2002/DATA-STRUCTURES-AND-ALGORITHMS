CHECK IF QUEUE ELEMENTS ARE PAIRWISE CONSECUTIVE
Using two stacks :
Transfer all elements of the queue to one auxiliary stack aux.
Now, transfer the elements from this stack to another auxiliary stack aux2.
Start popping two elements from aux2 and then check the difference between these two elements.
If their difference is 1, continue for other pairs till one element is left in the stack.
Also, after popping, push them to queue simultaneously to maintain the original queue.
Finally, if there is any pair with a difference not equal to 1, return false, else return true.
