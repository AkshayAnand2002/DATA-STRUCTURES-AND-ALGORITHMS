Algorithm to Find Maximum Level sum in Binary Tree
The idea is to do a level order traversal and for each level calculate the sum of all the nodes of that level. 
If the sum is greater than maximum sum, update the maximum sum.
1)Create a queue, and push the root node to the queue. Initialize a variable maxSum as negative infinity.
2)While the queue is not empty repeat step 3 and 4.
3)At this moment one level is present in the queue. Initialize a variable named size as the size of queue and a variable sum as 0.
4)Run a loop from i = 0 to size, and at each iteration pop out an element from the queue.
  Add the value of this element to variable sum and push the children of popped out node to the queue. 
  At the end of the loop if sum is greater than maxSum, update maxSum as sum.
5)Return maxSum.
